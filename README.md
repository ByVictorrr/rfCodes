# rfCodes

My research I have done for rolling codes and rf and reverse engineering those.

## What does rf stand for?

rf stands for radio frequency.

## What actually is radio frequency.

radio frequency is a subset of the electromagnetic spectrum, with wavelength ranging from as high as 300 gigahertz (GHz) to as low as 30 hertz.

## How to produce a radio wave?

A radio wave is an electromagnetic wave, which consists of a changing magnetic and electric wave moving through space changing with time.

To produce a wave that is considered a radio wave, we can accelerate particles trhough wires.
